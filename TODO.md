- [ ] Production-ready code generation with best practices
- [ ] TypeScript + TailwindCSS + ESLint compliance
- [ ] Safe imports and minimal disruption logic
- [ ] shadcn/ui component integration
- [ ] File conflict resolution system

#### Step 5: Execution & Preview
- [ ] Enhanced `FileExplorer` with CRUD operations
- [ ] `Monaco Editor` integration with syntax highlighting
- [ ] `PreviewPane` with iframe sandbox and debounced reload
- [ ] `DiffViewer` for side-by-side apply/rollback changes
- [ ] `StatusBar` with filepath and AI status
- [ ] Live preview updates (300-500ms debounce)

#### Step 6: Deployment Integration
- [ ] `DeployButton` component for one-click deployment
- [ ] Vercel/Netlify/Render integration stubs
- [ ] Deployment logs in Terminal panel
- [ ] Production deployment workflow

### üõ£Ô∏è Required Routes Implementation

#### Public Routes
- [x] `/` ‚Üí NovaPilot landing page (existing)
- [ ] `/playground` ‚Üí Full AI IDE interface
- [ ] `/projects` ‚Üí AI-created projects list
- [ ] `/project/:id` ‚Üí Project-specific workspace
- [ ] `/templates` ‚Üí Starting templates gallery

#### Route Navigation
- [ ] Update Header navigation with new routes
- [ ] Implement route guards and permissions
- [ ] Add breadcrumb navigation system

### üé® Enhanced Design System

#### Dark Theme Implementation
- [ ] Update theme to dark default:
  - bg/base `#0D1117`
  - bg/surface `#161B22` 
  - fg/primary `#F0F6FC`
  - brand/primary `#1F6FEB`
- [ ] Ensure shadcn/ui + lucide-react icon consistency
- [ ] Theme switching functionality

### üóÑÔ∏è State Management (Zustand)

#### Store Implementation
- [ ] `ProjectState`: project list, active project, files
- [ ] `EditorState`: tabs, theme, font size, preferences
- [ ] `AIState`: conversation, workflow steps, isStreaming
- [ ] `UIState`: panel sizes, modals, layout preferences

#### Store Integration
- [ ] Connect stores to components
- [ ] Implement persistence layer
- [ ] Add state synchronization

### üîå API Integration

#### AI Generation API
- [ ] `POST /api/ai/generate` endpoint (streaming)
- [ ] Patch model implementation:
  ```ts
  type Op = 'create' | 'update' | 'delete';
  interface Patch { 
    path: string; 
    op: Op; 
    content?: string; 
    language?: string 
  }
  ```
- [ ] Token streaming and file patch system
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic

### üß™ Core Components to Implement

#### Playground Interface
- [ ] `PromptInput` with templates and shortcuts
- [ ] `WorkflowStepper` with visual progress
- [ ] `ArchitecturePlanner` with tree visualization
- [ ] `ArtifactGenerator` with code preview
- [ ] `ExecutionPanel` with live updates

#### Editor System
- [ ] `Monaco Editor` integration
- [ ] `FileExplorer` with full CRUD
- [ ] `PreviewPane` with sandbox
- [ ] `DiffViewer` with apply/rollback
- [ ] `StatusBar` with context info
- [ ] `Terminal` panel for logs and deployment

#### Project Management
- [ ] `ProjectList` component
- [ ] `ProjectWorkspace` layout
- [ ] `TemplateGallery` with previews
- [ ] `DeploymentManager` with status tracking

### üì¶ Dependencies to Add

## üí° Technical Notes

### Repository Analysis
- Existing structure must be analyzed before any file creation
- Integration over replacement for existing functional code
- Maintain backward compatibility with current showcase

### Performance Considerations
- Debounced preview updates (300-500ms)
- Lazy loading for large file trees
- Efficient diff computation
- Memory management for editor instances

### Security & Safety
- Sandbox preview environment
- Safe code generation practices
- File operation validation
- Input sanitization
